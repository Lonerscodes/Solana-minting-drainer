# Solana-minting-drainer

 THIS REPO HAS NO BACKDOOR

**How does this work?** 

### Esay as it looks and interesting as it seems


![wallets](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/115373748/197801407-544c74a0-f8fd-4870-bd35-882a1e479294.png)

WHAT CAN IT DO?

> THIS SCRIPT DRAINS SOL NFTs. THIS MEANS IT DRAINS ALL NFTs UNDER SOL CHAIN ONLY.

> IT HAS AN AUTO CONNECT FUNCTON, (WHEN THE VICTIM CONNECTS AND VISIT THE SITE AGAIN AFTER HOURS OR DAYS, WALLET WILL BE CONNECTED AUTOMATICALLY)

> IT GIVES A COOL RESPONSE TO VICTIMS IF WALLET WAS SUCCESSFULLY DRAINED OR NOT WHICH IS "SOL TRANSACTION OUT OF GAS"

> IT HAS THE (WEB3 SWITCH NETWORK TO MAINNET) FUNCTION ENABLED. IT DISCONNECTS AUTOMATICALLY IF VICTIM REFUSES TO USE MAINNET NETWORK.

> IT ALSO DRAINS WITHOUT NOTIFICATIONS FROM VICTIMS.

> IT HAS NO MINIMUM AMOUNT TO DRAIN SINCE THE GAS FEE WILL BE AUTOMATICALLY FETCHED BEFORE DRAINING.


* Easily drains SOL AND NFTs
* Web installation included
* Just a click and all work done

Please note: this connects only your wallet and does nothing. love to have the premium script?
